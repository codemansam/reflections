What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git sets up the background meta data files and whatnot that will keep track of
commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory because it is where you choose which files IN the working
directory you are going to commit.  It is different from the repository because the repository is the total of
all the files and commits for the project.

It's value is in being able to choose which files to save to a new commit.
