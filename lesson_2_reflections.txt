What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git sets up the background meta data files and whatnot that will keep track of
commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory because it is where you choose which files IN the working
directory you are going to commit.  It is different from the repository because the repository is the total of
all the files and commits for the project.

It's value is in being able to choose which files to save to a new commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can compare the staging area to the working directory and make sure that you aren't trying to
add too many different files with more than one logical change at a time.  You might realise that there
are more changes in the working directory than you first realised and decide to drop a file from the
commit to make a seperate one.
