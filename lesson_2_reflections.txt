What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git sets up the background meta data files and whatnot that will keep track of
commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory because it is where you choose which files IN the working
directory you are going to commit.  It is different from the repository because the repository is the total of
all the files and commits for the project.

It's value is in being able to choose which files to save to a new commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can compare the staging area to the working directory and make sure that you aren't trying to
add too many different files with more than one logical change at a time.  You might realise that there
are more changes in the working directory than you first realised and decide to drop a file from the
commit to make a seperate one.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If you were making an experimental change that you aren't sure you will keep for the final version. Anything
that isn't going to be an iterative change but a drastic or unrelated departure from what you currently have
like a different language setting.  Branches help because you could go a long way down an offshoot idea and then decide it's not working after all and abandon that branch.  If you are working on a lot of features for a narrow
aspect of your program it makes sense that someone can check the commits related to that particular thing rather
than finding it all mixed in with the work being done in the master branch.  It would obviously help when multiple people are working on a piece of software.  The project can be broken up and different people can work on different aspects.  Anyone who needs to figure out what someone else has been doing can look at their branch and read the commit log to see how progress is being made.
